Project Implementation Plan – Small Hotel Booking System
1. Define the Requirements
📌 Project Summary
Build a full-stack hotel booking system with customer-facing and admin-facing interfaces. The system allows users to register, log in, browse rooms, book rooms, and manage their bookings. Admins can manage rooms, reservations, and view reports.

💻 Stack of Technologies
Frontend: React (Context API, useReducer, React Router, validator, localStorage, Bootstrap for UI)

Backend: Node.js with Express (CORS, express-validator)

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

File Hosting: Cloudinary (for room images)

Authentication: JWT (access tokens), cookies (for sessions)

Version Control: GitHub

Issues, Kanban Board

Feature Branches (feature-branch-yourname)

Pull Requests for code review

✨ Core Features
👤 User Authentication
Register / Login / Logout

Email verification

Forgot / Reset password

Change password

Remember me (via cookies/localStorage)

🛏️ Room Management
Admin: Create / Edit / Delete rooms (CRUD)

Add descriptions, prices, availability, features

📅 Booking System
Users can view available rooms by date

Make a reservation (select room, date, number of guests)

Cancel or update reservation

Store reservation in DB

📦 Admin Dashboard

🖥️ System Requirements
CPU: 2 cores

Memory: 2–4 GB RAM

// Room
{ title, description, pricePerNight, photos, capacity, amenities, isAvailable }

// Booking

3. Implementation (Coding)
Create a feature-branch-yourname for each feature

Example features:

feature-user-authentication

feature-room-management

feature-booking-system

Implement and test the feature locally

Push to GitHub and create a Pull Request

4. Testing
Use a combination of manual and automated tools:

Postman – for testing APIs

Jest – unit tests (e.g., for utility functions, reducers)

React Testing Library – for frontend components

Playwright / Selenium – for UI end-to-end testing

Cucumber.js – for behavior-driven testing (optional)
